## Enhance Your Site's Performance

Loading speed is crucial for retaining visitors. A slow site can frustrate users and increase bounce rates. Here are some strategies to optimize performance:

1. **File Minification**: Reduce the size of CSS and JavaScript files.
2. **Image Optimization**: Use appropriate formats and lossless compression.
3. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for images and resources.

By applying these techniques, you will improve not only the user experience but also your search engine ranking.
