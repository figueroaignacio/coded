## What is CSS?

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows you to apply styles to web pages, including design aspects like colors, fonts, and spacing.

## Basic Syntax

CSS rules are made up of a selector and a set of properties.

**Example:**

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

## Selectors

Selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling. Common selectors include:

### Element Selector

Targets elements by their tag name.

```css
p {
  color: green;
}
```

### Class Selector

Targets elements with a specific class attribute.

```css
.my-class {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

### ID Selector

Targets a unique element with a specific ID.

```css
#my-id {
  margin: 10px;
}
```

## Layout Techniques

CSS provides several methods for creating layouts:

### Flexbox

A layout model for distributing space in a container.

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Grid

A layout system for creating complex grid-based designs.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

## Conclusion

CSS is essential for styling and laying out web pages. By mastering the basics of selectors, properties, and layout techniques, you can create visually appealing and well-structured websites.
