# What is HTML?

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It provides the basic structure for web documents and allows you to organize content into elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. Understanding HTML is essential for building and structuring websites effectively.

## Basic Structure

### HTML Document Structure

An HTML document is composed of various elements organized into a hierarchy. The basic structure includes:

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`:** Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- **`<html>`:** The root element that contains all the content on the webpage.
- **`<head>`:** Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and links to stylesheets.
- **`<body>`:** Contains the content of the webpage, including text, images, and other elements.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Key Elements

### Headings

Headings are used to define the structure and hierarchy of content. HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`, where `<h1>` is the highest level and `<h6>` is the lowest.

**Example:**

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Sub-subheading</h3>
```

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are used to group and separate blocks of text. Use the `<p>` element to create paragraphs

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

### Links

Links are used to navigate to other webpages or resources. The `<a>` element is used to create hyperlinks. The href attribute specifies the URL of the link.

**Example:**

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

### Images

Images can be embedded in a webpage using the `<img>` element. The src attribute specifies the path to the image file, and the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image.

**Example:**

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image" />
```

### Lists

Lists are used to group related items. HTML supports ordered lists `<ol>` and unordered lists `<ul>`. List items are defined with the `<li>` element.

**Example:**

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

### Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are specified within the opening tag of an element and typically come in name-value pairs.

**Example:**

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>
```

- `href`: Specifies the URL for the link.
- `target`: Defines where to open the link (e.g., \_blank for a new tab).

## Conclusion

HTML is the foundation of web development, allowing you to structure and format content on the web. By understanding the basic elements and attributes, you can create well-organized and effective webpages. As you advance, you can explore additional features and integrations with CSS and JavaScript to enhance your websites.
